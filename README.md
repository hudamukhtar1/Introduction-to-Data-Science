# Introduction-to-Data-Science
This course introduces machine learning and statistical methods for data analysis through applied examples.
Particular emphasis is placed on how to rigorously evaluate an analysis of data. Topics include:
* Supervised Learning and Model Fitting
* Statistics, Prediction, and Maximum Likelihood
* Introduce test set/out-of-sample idea.
* Classification, Evaluation, Logistic regression Regularization, Multi-class problems
* Estimating Performance, Quantifying Uncertainty on parameter estimates and on model
predictions
* Test error, Cross-validation, Model Selection, Bias-Variance tradeoff
* Feature Selection and Regularization (L1 and L2)
* Trees, Random Forest
* Neural Networks, Gradients, learning
* Autoencoders, Dimensionality reduction, PCA, NMF, tSNE
* Clustering, K-means, hierarchical clustering
* Model limitations, Causality.
